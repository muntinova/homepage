        <p class="question">4. What is "Unobtrusive Javascript"? What is the practical application of Unobtrusive Javascript (and the reasons for using it)?
       </p>
        <p class="answer">Answer:</p>
        <p>
            Unobtrusive JavaScript is the way of writing JavaScript language in which we properly separate Document Content and Script Content thus allowing us to make a clear distinction between them.
            This approach is useful in so many ways as it makes our code less error prone, easy to update and to debug.
            The basic concept of unobtrusive programming is that JavaScript should be used as an enhancement to our web page instead of an absolute requirement.
            If you do not need JavaScript, then don't use it; your static content will display just fine with plain old HTML and CSS.
            So many developers make the mistake of importing code libraries before even figuring out if they will be even required.
            jQuery for example has been so much mis-used when all our basic needs can be easily fulfilled by CSS and pure JavaScript code.
